-Learning function, tree construction and dataset building are provided from aima site
(https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/learning.py). These are been modified 
to adapt them to my problem;

-Python version 2.7;

-This program requires 3 libraries: 1 "matplotlib" for plotting;
				    2 "print_function" to use python 3.x's function;
				    3 "random" to shuffle examples at each iteration;
	
-To start the program is needed to execute "Testing.py" script. This file contains attributes
and targets of each dataset. Once started a GUI reqeusts to select the dataset to use, to set
"m_range"(a default value is provided; be careful an high value could take long time!) and to
choose pruning type. At the end the plot of learning curves will be displayed and a raw tree 
that shows the result of 1 execution without pre-pruning.
